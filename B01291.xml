            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE <hi>Ancient Burrough</hi> OF Knaresborough, In the County of <hi>YORK,</hi> In the Return of <hi>THOMAS FAWKES</hi> Eſq; to Serve as one of the Repreſentatives of the ſaid Burrough, in this CONVENTION.</head>
            <p>THE Proprietors of Burgage-Houſes within this Burrough, and none other, Elect by Preſcription, and the Return is made by the Bayliff of the ſaid Burrough for the time being, who hath Returned as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Purſuant</hi> to His Highneſs the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi>'s Letter to me directed, and hereto affixt, I do certifie the Clerk of the Crown of the High Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> That the Burrough-men of the ancient Burrough of <hi>Knaresborough,</hi> in the County of <hi>York,</hi> on the twelfth day of this Inſtant <hi>January,</hi> with an unanimous Conſent, have freely choſe <hi>William Stockdale</hi> Eſq; to be one of their two Repreſentatives in the Convention to be held at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Twenty-ſecond of this inſtant <hi>January.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Lord Viſcount <hi>Latimer</hi> by the majority of the Ancient and New Votes together.</p>
            <p>Or <hi>Thomas Fawkes</hi> Eſq; by the majority of the Ancient Votes, who has been Sworn in Court, and relief'd for their Burrough-Houſes, according to the Cuſtom of the Burrough, to be th' other of their two Repreſentatives in the ſaid Convention.</p>
            <p>The ancient Votes for Mr. <hi>Fawkes,</hi> agreed on all ſides to be good, were Twenty-five.</p>
            <p>The Ancient Votes for the Lord <hi>Latimer</hi> agreed on all ſides to be good, were Nineteen; and the New Votes transferred lately, but otherways good, were Eighteen. To the truth of this Pole I have hereunto ſet my Hand, and the Common Seal of the ſaid Burrough, the Twelfth of <hi>January, Anno Dom.</hi> 1688.</p>
            <p>☞ Note, <hi>That the New Votes in the Return above-recited therein, ſaid to be transferred lately, were transferred (if at all) by a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſſigning of Burgages, after the Date and Receipt of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Letter (by the ſaid Bayliff) and after the Court called by him for the ſaid Election; which was done colourably only, and on purpoſe to ſerve a Turn. So that the ſaid New Votes ought not to have been taken Notice of, and by conſequence the ſaid Mr.</hi> Fawkes <hi>was Legally Elected by a Majority of Votes, according to the Cuſtom of the ſaid Burrough.</hi>
